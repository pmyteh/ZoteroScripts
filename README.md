ZoteroScripts
=============

Various scripts for use with Zotero.

* `purgeTags.js`: Purge all but a specified set of tags from your library. Use with something like the ExecuteJS add-on for Firefox.
* `CanonicaliseISBN.py`: Convert all ISBNs in the library to the standard dashed form (and report any bogus ISBNs which can't be automatically converted).

All the snippets here are in the public domain, under the terms of the CC0 dedication, unless stated otherwise.
